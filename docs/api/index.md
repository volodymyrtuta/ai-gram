All API methods and types is fully autogenerated from Telegram Bot API docs by parser with code-generator

Package: `aiogram.api`

## Methods

All API methods is wrapped as **pydantic** models and placed in `aiogram.api.methods` package so that's mean all values which you pass as arguments to the methods will be validated. 
Here is all methods is classes and in due to Python standards all classes named in upper camel case, for example methods `sendMessage` has the name `SendMessage`
Also in places where you can send 

## Types

All types is also wrapped with **pydantic** and placed in `aiogram.api.types` package.
In this place makes some more differences with official documentations:

- name `from` was renamed to `from_user` in due to `from` is an keyword in python
- timestamps has `datetime.datetime` type instead of `int`
- InputFile is used for sending files and is not use `pydantic.BaseModel` as base class
