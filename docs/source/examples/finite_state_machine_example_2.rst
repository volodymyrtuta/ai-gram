Finite state machine example 2
==============================

This example is equals with 'finite_state_machine_example.py' but with FSM Middleware
Note that FSM Middleware implements the more simple methods for working with storage.
With that middleware all data from storage will be loaded before event will be processed
and data will be stored after processing the event.
